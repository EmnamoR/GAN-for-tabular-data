# GANs for tabular data
GANs are well known for the realistic image generation. However, they can be used in tabular data generation as well. Here I would like to review one of recent state of the art paper in tabular generation.

## Used datasets and expriment design

**Task formalization**

Let say we have **T_train** and **T_test** (train and test set respectively). We need to train the model on **T_train** and make predictions on **T_test**. However, we will increase the train by generating new data by GAN, somehow similar to **T_test**, without using ground truth labels of it.

**Experiment design**

Let say we have **T_train** and **T_test** (train and test set respectively). The size of **T_train** is smaller and might have different data distribution. First of all, we train CTGAN on **T_train** with ground truth labels (step 1), then generate additional data **T_synth** (step 2). Secondly, we train boosting in an adversarial way on concatenated **T_train** and **T_synth** (target set to 0) with **T_test** (target set to 1) (steps 3 & 4). The goal is to apply newly trained adversarial boosting to obtain rows more like **T_test**. Note - initial ground truth labels aren't used for adversarial training. As a result, we take top rows from **T_train** and **T_synth** sorted by correspondence to **T_test** (steps 5 & 6), and train new boosting on them and check results on **T_test**.

Of course for the benchmark purposes we will test ordinal training without these tricks and another original pipeline but without CTGAN (in step 3 we won't use **T_sync**).

**Datasets**

All datasets came from different domains. They have a different number of observations, number of categorical and numerical features. 
The objective for all datasets - binary classification. 
Preprocessing of datasets were simple: removed all time-based columns from datasets. 
Remaining columns were either categorical or numerical.

## Results

To determine the best encoderthe ROC AUC scores of each dataset were scaled (min-max scale) and then averaged results among the dataset. 
To determine the best validation strategy, I compared the top score of each dataset for each type of validation. 

**Table 1.2** Different sampling results across the dataset, higher is better (100% - maximum per dataset ROC AUC)

| dataset_name  |   None |   gan |   sample_original |
|:-----------------------|-------------------:|------------------:|------------------------------:|
| credit                 |           0.997 |          **0.998** |                      0.997 |
| employee               |           **0.986** |          0.966 |                      0.972 |
| mortgages              |           0.984 |          0.964 |                      **0.988** |
| poverty_A              |           0.937 |          **0.950** |                      0.933 |
| taxi                   |           0.966 |          0.938 |                      **0.987** |
| adult                  |           0.995 |          0.967 |                      **0.998** |
| telecom                |           **0.995** |          0.868 |                      0.992 |

**Table 1.3** Different sampling results, higher is better for a mean (ROC AUC), lower is better for std (100% - maximum per dataset ROC AUC)

| sample_type     |     mean |       std |
|:----------------|---------:|----------:|
| None            | 0.980 | 0.036 |
| gan             | 0.969 | 0.06 |
| sample_original | **0.981** | **0.032** |

**Table 1.4** same_target_prop is equal 1 then the target rate for train and test are different no more than 5%. Higher is better.

| sample_type     |   same_target_prop |   prop_test_score |
|:----------------|-------------------:|------------------:|
| None            |                  0 |          0.964 |
| None            |                  1 |          0.985 |
| gan             |                  0 |          0.966 |
| gan             |                  1 |          0.945 |
| sample_original |                  0 |          0.973 |
| sample_original |                  1 |          0.984 |
